//in this calss has a std::vector and each element having an integer from 0 to 9 as each digit of the integer 
//defualt constructor intializes the integer to 0 
// it has a constructor with the unsigned int type as a parameter and intializes the internal integer to an argument
// it has a constructor with the type std::string as a parameter, initializing the internal integer to an argumenrt and the character in the nth position is the nth digit of the internal integer
// addition is possible with + operator and integer output is possible using std::cout and <<
