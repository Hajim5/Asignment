/* Question 
Define a BigUnsigned class that stores a large range of zeros and positive integers to have the following characteristics (also write a test code and include it as a result)

(a) The member storing the integer is std:vector, each element having an integer from 0 to 9 as each digit of the integer.
(b) The default constructor initializes the integer to zero.
(c) It has a constructor with the unsigned int type as a parameter and initializes the internal integer to an argument.
(d) It has a constructor with the type std::string as a parameter, initializing the internal integer to an argument, and the character in the nth position is the nth digit of the internal integer.
(e) Addition is possible with + operator, and integer output is possible using std::cout and <<.

#include<iostream>
#include<vector>

class BigUnsigned{ 
public:
};

int main () {
}
